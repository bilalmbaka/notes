# What is fiscal deficit (national deficit) ?

[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscaldeficit.asp)

**_Fiscal_**: relating to government revenue, especially taxes.

A fiscal deficit refers to the shortfall in a government’s revenue
compared to its spending during a certain period. When a country
runs a fiscal deficit, it means the government spends beyond its means.
Fiscal deficits are calculated either as a percentage of a country’s
gross domestic product (GDP) or by determining the amount of spending over revenue.

Fiscal deficits are different from fiscal debts and fiscal imbalances.
They are also the opposite of fiscal surpluses.

Fiscal deficits don’t include a country’s debts.

Governments often run deficits when there are signs of a distressed
economy. For instance, they may reduce taxes or increase spending to
encourage consumer spending or boost economic activity. This typically
happens when there is inflationary pressure or the economy is going
through a recession. A government that needs more money than it can
spend typically borrows money from the public or other governments.

The income figure used to calculate a country’s fiscal deficit
(or surplus) includes only taxes and other revenues. It does not
include money borrowed to make up the shortfall.

## Fiscal Deficit vs. Fiscal Debt vs. Fiscal Imbalance

### Fiscal Debt

Remember, a fiscal deficit means the government spends more than it earns
in revenue.

The term “fiscal debt” is also called a national debt. A fiscal debt,
on the other hand, is the total amount of debt that a government owes
to its creditors. Governments often borrow money to pay for certain expenditures,
including infrastructure and social programs.

A country’s fiscal debt is accumulated over years of deficit spending and
is composed of different types of debt, including:

- Debt held by the public, such as bonds, bills, and notes
- Debt held by foreign countries
- Trust funds held by the federal government

As of Jan. 27, 2025, the U.S. government’s fiscal debt was roughly $36.22 trillion.
Of this figure, $28.86 trillion was held by the public while over $7.35 trillion
covered intragovernmental holdings.

### Fiscal Imbalance

Fiscal deficits are also different from fiscal imbalances. A fiscal
imbalance is a measure of the difference between future debt obligations
and future revenue streams. This means that a country’s future debt
isn’t in line with its future revenue.

Fiscal imbalances happen when a country’s spending isn’t able to keep
up with its ability to earn revenue to fund its spending and debt obligations
over the long term.
