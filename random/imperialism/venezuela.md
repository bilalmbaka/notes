# Why did Venezuela’s economy collapse?

The Venezuelan economy has suffered from decades of disastrous
economic policies – and more recently, from **economic sanctions**.

Living standards in oil-rich Venezuela plummeted by a staggering 74%
between 2013 and 2023. This is the fifth largest fall in living standards
in modern economic history.

## Before the collapse (1999 to 2013): bad macroeconomic policy

Government spending was deeply pro-cyclical. Instead of saving at
least some money for bad times during the good times – as Norway,
Saudi Arabia and virtually all other oil exporters have done –
the Venezuelan government ran double-digit [fiscal deficits](/random/economics/fiscal_deficit.md) as
the economy boomed. Government spending far outpaced income from
taxes and other revenues.

To finance these unnecessary shortfalls, they raised the external
debt sixfold by saddling the state-owned oil company and government
with over $100 billion _**Up from what?**_ in obligations.

The country also became increasingly reliant on the central bank printing
money after gutting its independence. _**source needed**_

Government spending during the oil boom was extremely inefficient.
Subsidised gasoline in Venezuela was not just the cheapest in the
world but often virtually free. This led to an estimated 100,000
barrels of petrol worth over $10 billion per year being smuggled
across the border to Brazil and Colombia each day, where it could be
resold at a profit. _**what is wrong with this?**_ how much is gasoline in _**uae?**_

Electricity subsidies were also vast, leading to losses and underinvestment
in the sector. In total, subsidies are estimated to have cost over 10% of GDP
in some years, accounting for over half of the fiscal deficits. _**i dont understand how this could cause deficit isn't it from the oil revenue that electicity is been subsidized from?**_

At the same time, the all-important oil industry was starved of investment
funds and badly mismanaged as technical experts were replaced with political allies.
Oil production in fields with high-quality crudes operated by the national oil company,
Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), fell rapidly. _**Proof needed**_

These losses were masked by production gains in lower-quality fields operated by
joint ventures with foreign oil companies. As such, the profits and sustainability
of the country’s largest export were undermined, with overall production falling
from around three million barrels per day (mbpd) at the turn of the century to
2.3 mbpd before the crisis began in 2014.

## Before the collapse (1999 to 2013): bad microeconomic policy

From 1999 onwards, the government expropriated broad swathes of the economy,
often without compensation and on national TV broadcasts, crushing business
confidence and investment.

Over a thousand firms and several million hectares of land were nationalised
in the agriculture, banking, cement, iron, oil, manufacturing, retail and
telecommunications sectors. Most of these businesses have closed and
those that haven’t closed operate at fractions of their peak output. _**proof needed**_

In 2003, Venezuela also imposed capital controls and a byzantine
system for foreign currency purchases. There were one or more official
exchange rates where the government subsidised dollar purchases and demand
vastly outstripped supply, as well as a black market with its own free-floating
exchange rate determined by market forces.

The system was deeply distortionary. An entire industry of non-productive
ghost companies cropped up to lobby the government for subsidised dollars
(to resell them on the black market for an immediate profit). _**proof needed**_

At the same time, legitimate value-adding businesses were unable to get
reliable access to the foreign currency needed to operate.
Many genuine businesses also specialised away from productive activities
towards securing cheap dollars.

Worse yet, the government set prices for thousands of retail goods by decree:
from rice and chicken to soap and toilet paper. Price caps were often too low,
so producers could not cover their costs, leading to shortages, smuggling and
bankruptcies.

The government also capped profits in 2011 and enforced the caps with draconian
inventory seizures and jail time for workers and executives. Punitive labour
regulations also made firing employees extremely risky, costly and time consuming. _**proof needed**_

Taken together, this web of anti-market measures hamstrung domestic production,
making the country extremely reliant on imports, even for products that Venezuela
had previously exported, such as rice. The country also lost an estimated
$300 billion to corruption through its foreign currency system and other schemes,
which it could have instead saved for periods of lower oil prices.

## The collapse (2014 to the present): denial, emigration and hyperinflation

Oil prices are volatile and when they plummeted from $100 to $40 per barrel
in the summer of 2014.

To continue paying down the $100 billion plus in debt incurred during the
boom, the government was forced to cut foreign exchange allocations for
imports more aggressively than the fall in export revenues. It was all
for nothing, as the country defaulted on its debt a few years later anyway.

As oil prices sagged, Maduro ignored calls to repeal currency, price and
profit controls. Instead, he doubled down on intervention. The government
continued to assign dollars at subsidised exchange rates to cronies and
political allies, even though the country barely had any dollars and could
not afford the vastly inefficient system. _**proof needed**_

Even as GDP contracted for the third and fourth consecutive year
(by a colossal 17% in 2016 and 16% in 2017), Maduro refused to rationalise
economic policy. The fiscal deficit widened to record levels as taxes and
the oil industry collapsed.

Instead of cutting spending, the government began to finance an ever-greater
share of the budget with money printing from the central bank. The money
supply was regularly expanded by 20-30% per month, pushing Venezuela into
a hyperinflationary spiral. _**proof needed**_

By the end of the decade, the Venezuelan economy had contracted 61%
in per capita terms. This was already the 15th largest economic crisis
in modern history and the largest outside war, revolution or state collapse.

## The collapse (2019 to the present): sanctions

In 2019, the United States led an international effort to oust Maduro
from power after his six-year term expired. The ‘maximum pressure’
campaign involved recognising congressman Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s
legitimate president and imposing sanctions on Venezuela and its
national oil company, PDVSA.

The primary sanctions from 2019 froze the country’s assets in the
United States and cut it off from the US oil market. These were
serious but more significantly, US President Donald Trump imposed
secondary sanctions on PDVSA a year later, subjecting any othercountry
or company that did business with PDVSA to US sanctions.

Secondary sanctions cut Venezuela off from formal global oil markets
and forced PDVSA to sell its products on the black market to partners
that charge high mark-ups in exchange for ‘laundering’ the sanctioned oil.

The impact of these secondary sanctions was immediate. Venezuela’s oil
production – which was already down 50% after years of underinvestment
– plummeted further. Headline oil production fell from 1,500 thousand
barrels per day (kbpd) before primary sanctions to a low of 337
kbpd in June 2020 after secondary sanctions. This has since recovered to 850 kbpd today.

GDP per capita bottomed in 2020 once the economy had contracted 73%
from the start of the crisis and has been flat or up slightly on the
recovery of the oil sector and emigration. _**proof needed**_<br/>
_**if countries care so much about another country and "free and fair elections" whey do they impose sanctions on another country? since this sanctions as far as i know always affects the citizens and not the person in power?**_
