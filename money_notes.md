Monetary policy (a series of strategies for controlling money supply) plays a significant role in shaping the economic landscape of every country.

An important tool within this policy framework is the monetary policy rate (or MPR).

The monetary policy rate is the benchmark interest rate set by the Central Bank of Nigeria. It’s a key tool for economic regulation — serving as a guide for other interest rates in the economy — and can indirectly influence how much you earn on savings accounts and certain investments.

The country’s apex bank — the Central Bank of Nigeria (or CBN) — uses the MPR to regulate and influence the country’s economy since it (more or less) dictates the rates at which other financial institutions (including commercial banks) lend to their customers.

When the CBN raises the MPR, borrowing becomes costlier for financial institutions. This, in turn, increases the interest rates they offer to businesses and individuals seeking loans or credit facilities.

Of course, the reverse is also true. Lowering MPR makes borrowing cheaper for financial institutions and can lead to lower interest rates for borrowers.

But how does the monetary policy rate differ from the interest rate?

While the MPR affects baseline interest rates indirectly and is dictated by the CBN, banks and other financial institutions determine interest rates based on various factors like market conditions and credit risk.

### Who controls Nigeria’s monetary policy rate?

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the CBN is responsible for setting and adjusting the monetary policy rate. This committee is made up of experts in various fields (like economics, finance and banking) who bring their knowledge and experience to the table when making decisions about the MPR.

### What does it mean to increase the monetary policy rate?

When the CBN increases the MPR, it signals to commercial banks that borrowing will be more costly. This results in higher interest rates offered by commercial banks to borrowers.

These higher interest rates may then discourage borrowing and investment since businesses and individuals are likely to find it more expensive to access credit.

Increasing the MPR can also affect the exchange rate of a country’s currency. As interest rates rise, foreign investors may find it more attractive to invest in the country’s financial assets — leading to an appreciation of the currency. This can have positive and negative effects on the economy — affecting exports, imports, and the overall balance of payments.

However, it is important to note that the decision to increase the monetary policy rate is usually taken by the MPC after careful consideration of various economic indicators (such as inflation, economic growth and employment levels).


### Why does the CBN adjust the monetary policy rate?

The CBN uses the MPR to control inflation and stimulate economic growth. By adjusting the MPR, it can achieve its monetary policy objectives — which often include maintaining price stability and promoting sustainable economic growth.

By increasing the MPR, the country’s apex bank can reduce the amount of money in circulation and help lower inflation rates. On the other hand, lowering the MPR can encourage borrowing and spending — thus boosting economic activity.

The monetary policy rate also has an impact on the Nigerian Naira exchange rate. When the CBN adjusts the MPR, it can influence the value of the Naira against other currencies (especially the Dollar). This change can then affect imports and exports, as a stronger Naira makes imports cheaper but can hurt export competitiveness.

Still, it’s important to note that while the MPR is not the sole determinant of the exchange rate. Other factors (such as global economic conditions and commodity prices — especially oil for Nigeria) also play significant roles.

## How does the monetary policy rate influence the economy?

The MPR has a direct impact on inflation. When the Central Bank adjusts the baseline for interest rates, it trickles down to individual and corporate borrowers. Higher interest rates can reduce borrowing, leading to decreased consumer spending.

This, in turn, can help manage inflation by limiting the money supply and curbing excessive demand.

MPR doesn’t just affect borrowing. It can also impact the interest you earn on savings and investments — potentially affecting your overall financial situation.

# CHAPTER 2
# What Is Inflation?

### What is headline inflation?

Headline inflation is a commonly used measure that represents the overall price level in an economy. It takes into account the price changes of a basket of goods and services commonly consumed by households in Nigeria (like rice, garri and bread), providing a broad perspective on inflation trends.

This measure of inflation is similar to core inflation — which excludes volatile items like food and energy prices. However, including these volatile items in headline inflation can sometimes lead to fluctuations in the reported rate, making it a more volatile measure than core inflation.

Still, headline and core inflation are essential metrics for assessing prices, the value of money, and the economy.

### Some types of inflation?

* Demand-pull inflation. This occurs when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, leading to increased prices.

* Cost-push inflation. This happens when the cost of production for businesses increases, forcing them to pass on the additional costs to consumers.

* Hyperinflation. This is an extreme form of inflation characterised by rapid price increases, often reaching astronomical levels.

* Built-in inflation. This type of inflation occurs when workers demand wage increases to keep up with the rising cost of living. As businesses raise wages to retain employees, they often increase prices to maintain profit margins — creating a terrible cycle of inflation.

But it’s not all bad. Inflation can significantly impact interest rates in a country. High inflation rates often lead to higher interest rates as lenders (for example, banks) seek to compensate for the decreased purchasing power of money over time.

Unfortunately, while this act can benefit savers and investors, it can also make borrowing more expensive — potentially slowing down economic growth and investment in the country.
