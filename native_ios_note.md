## Stuct vs class

__What are value types?__ 

*A value type is a type whose value is copied when it’s assigned to a variable or constant, or when it’s passed to a function.*

Structures are value types.

__What are reference types?__

*Reference types are not copied when they’re assigned to a variable or constant, or when they’re passed to a function. Rather than a copy, a reference to the same existing instance is used.*

Classes are reference types.
